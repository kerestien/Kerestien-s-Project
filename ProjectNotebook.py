# # Project Description

# My project is a quiz about the show The Office. I chose The Office because I'm literally obesessed with that show. The quiz has 10 questions with 3 answer choices each and you have to either write in the full answer or just the corresponding letter. In the quiz, if you get the answers correct, you gain a point. If not, your score stays the same. And then at the end of the quiz, you get your final score and also a statement telling you whether you passed or not. 

# ## Project Code

# If it makes sense for your project, you can have code and outputs here in the notebook as well.

# 1) I've never had any Python exeperience so I struggled a lot with this project and it took me a little longer than 10 hours because I kept restarting. 
# 2) I was going to take the final because it's more guided, but I decided to step out of my comfort zone knowing that I might have done some parts incorrectly in this project. But I'm happy I did that because I ended up figuring things out on my own, going back to lectures to find how to do certain things, and I also learned how to add color to make it look nicer!!
